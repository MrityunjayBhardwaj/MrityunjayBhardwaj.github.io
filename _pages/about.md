Greetings,

My name is Mrityunjay Bhardwaj( pretty scary name huh?) . I love learning and writing about new things especially the ones that are connected to Mathematics,Art,Graphics and Computer Science.

Although I was an award winning Cg Artist in my previous life but  for the past couple of  years in am fascinated by the field of Artificial Intelligence(especially RL and generative models),Pattern Recognition and Optimization and would like to understand and hopefully  contribute something to this field.

You can contact me if you like : mrityunjaybhardwaj99@gmail.com
