As is said in my <a href="#">previous post</a> most research paper are like a rabbit hole and it depends on you, how deep you want to dive in...here,we try to go it modest depth without going too deep into crazy mathematics(CCCP).

so TL;DR:

SVM with SMO:-
SVM is a linear classifier which can also create a non-linear decision boundary by projecting the data points into high-dimensional space also know as kernel trick...and we solve the expression either using quadratic progamming or using SMO which is a iterative algorithm developed by a microsoft researcher( <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr-98-14.pdf">platt et. al.</a> )

you can learn more about svm with smo here:-

LASVM:

this is one of the first online svm algorithm... the advantage of online svm is that is extremely faster then the vanilla svm and can also fit on really large datasets.

LASVM-G:
same as LASVM but instead use duality gap to its advantage

CCCP:
CCCP stands for Convex-Concave Procedure which is a way to produce non-convex behivour by combining bout convex and concave version of a function.
